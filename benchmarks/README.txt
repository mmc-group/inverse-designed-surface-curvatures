Demos of inverse designing surface curvatures are provided for bone, cvtub, PNS and spinodoid. By running 'main.py' in each folder, curvature plot will be generated 
in a seperate folder '/data_a-1/' for different data sources like '.mat' files for bone and spinodoid, or analytical function for PNS. With the generated curvature 
distributions, inverse design will be performed and design parameters can be obtained. Once design paramters are obtained, one can use script 'create_cvtub.py' to 
generate 3D microstructures.

Data source:

bone: scan_1.mat file is obtained from scan-CT images (Tozzi et al., https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/microCT_scans_of_bone_and_cement-bone_microstructures/4308926).

cvtub: field data are generated directly by 'create_cvtub.py'.

PNS: field data are generated by analytical functions.

spinodoid: GRF.mat is obtained from: S. Kumar, S. Tan, L. Zheng, D. M. Kochmann, Inverse-designed spinodoid metamaterials, npj Computational Materials, 6 (2020), 73. https://www.gibboncode.org/html/HELP_spinodoid.html.
